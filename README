NAME
    Pinto::Server - Web interface to a Pinto repository

VERSION
    version 0.001

DESCRIPTION
    You probably want to look at pinto-server first.

    Pinto::Server is a web API to a Pinto repository. Using this interface,
    remote clients (like pinto-remote) can add distributions, remove
    packages, and list the contents of the Pinto repository. In addition,
    Pinto::Server serves the entire contents of your repository, so you can
    use it as the source of distributions for cpan or cpanm.

    Before running Pinto::Server you must first create a Pinto repository.
    See pinto-admin for directions on that. Once you have a repository, the
    easiest way to run Pinto::Server is like this:

      $> pinto-server [OPTIONS]

    Pinto::Server is also PSGI compatible, so you can run it under Plack
    like this:

      $> plackup [OPTIONS] /path/to/pinto-server

CONFIGURATION
    Pinto::Server automatically uses your Pinto configuration file which is
    usually at $HOME/.pinto/config.ini. Or you can set the "PERL_PINTO"
    environment variable to point to another location.

    No additional configuration is required beyond what Pinto itself uses.
    However, Pinto::Server will always silently force the "nocommit" and
    "noinit" parameters to 0. Also, the "author" parameter is meaningless to
    Pinto::Server because clients all required to provide an author for any
    "add" or "remove" operations.

CAVEATS
    If you are running Pinto::Server and have configured Pinto to use a
    VCS-based store, such as Pinto::Store::Svn or Pinto::Store::Git, then
    you must not mess with the VCS directly (at least not the VCS
    directories that Pinto is using). This is because Pinto::Server only
    initializes the working copy of the Pinto repository at startup.
    Thereafter, it assumes that it is the only actor that affects its part
    of the VCS. If you start

LIMITATIONS
    Pinto::Server speaks HTTP, but does not actually serve HTML. At the
    moment, is geared toward command-line tools like pinto-client so it just
    returns plain text. This will probably change as Pinto::Server evolves
    into a real web application.
